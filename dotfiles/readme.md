# Ross' dotfiles

A collection of the dotfiles I use on my machines. Many of these come from the fantastic post by Simon Owen: <http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/setting-up-a-mac-dev-machine-from-zero-to-hero-with-dotfiles/>. His repo can be found at <https://github.com/s10wen/dotfiles/>.
